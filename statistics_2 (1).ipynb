What is a random variable in probability theory?\n","-   Random Variable: A numerical value representing the outcomes of a random experiment.\n","2.  What are the types of random variables?\n","Types:\n","  Discrete Random Variables: Take on a countable number of distinct values (e.g., number of heads in 10 coin flips).\n","  Continuous Random Variables: Take on an infinite number of possible values within a given range (e.g., height of students).\n","3.  What is the difference between discrete and continuous distributions?\n","-   Discrete vs. Continuous Distributions\n","  Discrete Distributions: Deal with discrete random variables (e.g., binomial distribution).\n","  Continuous Distributions: Deal with continuous random variables (e.g., normal distribution).\n","4. What are probability distribution functions (PDF)?\n","-  A PDF describes the likelihood of different outcomes for a random variable. It gives the probability that a random variable takes on a specific value (discrete) or falls within a range of values (continuous).\n","5. How do cumulative distribution functions (CDF) differ from probability distribution functions (PDF)?\n","-  A CDF gives the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a specific value. It accumulates probabilities up to that value.\n","* Difference from PDF: PDF provides probabilities for specific values/ranges; CDF provides cumulative probabilities up to a certain value.\n","6. What is a discrete uniform distribution?\n","-  A discrete uniform distribution assigns equal probability to each possible outcome in a finite set of equally likely values (e.g., rolling a fair die).\n","7. What are the key properties of a Bernoulli distribution?\n","-  Bernoulli Distribution\n","Key Properties:\n","    Two possible outcomes: success (1) and failure (0).\n","    Probability of success = 𝑝; probability of failure = 1−𝑝.\n","8. What is the binomial distribution, and how is it used in probability?\n","-  Models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials of a binary experiment.\n","Use: To calculate probabilities of a given number of successes in a series of trials (e.g., flipping a coin 10 times).\n","9. What is the Poisson distribution and where is it applied?\n","-  Models the number of events occurring within a fixed interval of time or space.\n","Applications: Customer arrivals, phone call frequencies, etc.\n","10. What is a continuous uniform distribution?\n","-   A continuous uniform distribution assigns equal probability to all values within a specified interval.\n","11. What are the characteristics of a normal distribution?\n","-   Characteristics:\n","  Symmetric, bell-shaped curve.\n","  Mean, median, and mode are equal.\n","  Defined by its mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ).\n","12. What is the standard normal distribution, and why is it important?\n","-   A normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. It is important for standardizing data and comparing different distributions.\n","13. What is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), and why is it critical in statistics?\n","-   The CLT states that the distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the original population's distribution.\n","    Importance: Allows the use of normal distribution for inference in various scenarios.\n","14. How does the Central Limit Theorem relate to the normal distribution?\n","-   The CLT explains why the normal distribution is ubiquitous in statistics and why sample means tend to be normally distributed.\n","15. What is the application of Z statistics in hypothesis testing?\n","-   Z-statistics are used to determine if a sample mean significantly differs from a population mean, aiding in hypothesis testing.\n","16. How do you calculate a Z-score, and what does it represent?\n","-   Calculating a Z-Score\n","    𝑍=(𝑋−𝜇)/𝜎\n","Represents: The number of standard deviations a data point is from the mean.\n","17. What are point estimates and interval estimates in statistics?\n","-   Point Estimates: Single values (e.g., sample mean) used to estimate population parameters.\n","    Interval Estimates: Range of values (e.g., confidence intervals) that likely contain the population parameter.\n","18. What is the significance of confidence intervals in statistical analysis?\n","-   Confidence intervals provide a range of plausible values for population parameters, offering more information than point estimates.\n","19. What is the relationship between a Z-score and a confidence interval?\n","-   Z-scores are used to calculate confidence intervals by determining the number of standard deviations a sample mean is from the population mean.\n","20. How are Z-scores used to compare different distributions?\n","-   Z-scores standardize data, allowing comparisons across different distributions.\n","21. What are the assumptions for applying the Central Limit Theorem?\n","-   Independent observations.\n","    Random sampling.\n","    Sample size sufficiently large (n > 30 is often used as a rule of thumb).\n","22. What is the concept of expected value in a probability distribution?\n","-   The expected value is the long-term average or mean value of a random variable. It is calculated by multiplying each possible value by its probability and summing the results.\n","23. How does a probability distribution relate to the expected outcome of a random variable?\n","-   The probability distribution defines the expected outcomes of a random variable by specifying the probabilities associated with each value.\n","# PRACTICAL\n","1.
